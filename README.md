# Work-Day-Scheduler-using-Third-Party-API-s

## Description

For this challenge I had to create a work day scheduler using third party APIs. The work day scheduler uses a text section for each hour of the day from 9am to 5pm. Each section will be color coded by hour, present hour will be red, green is upcoming hour, and gray is for the hours that have already passed. At the end of the timeblock 
I used a third party API for a save button and the save icon. When you enter text into the text area and save it you can refresh, and close the page and comeback later to find your entries still logged.
